# Module 16 - Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview 

#### The Amazon Vine Analysis was to look at products reviews for the chosen category of Watches, and determine if the Vine Program resulted in bias reviews. We used Colab and PySpark to achieve this.


## Results
#### Question - How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
#### **Vine: 47, non-Vine: 8362**

## Summary
#### I do not think there is positivity bias for Vine review for the Watch category. 31.9% of Vine reviews were 5-starts, compared to 51.8% of non-Vine reviews. 47 reviews is not many, it is possible that Vine reviews were simply for below-average products. It is also possible that Watch reviewers are more likely to leave a critiqued and honest review for there product as they could have a lot of pride in watches vs a reviewer for a category like Athletic Wear.
